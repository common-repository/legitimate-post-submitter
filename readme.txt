= About the Legitimate service and integration with this plugin =
www.legitimate.net is a content platform that shows content based on the creator. This plugin lets Legitimate users automatically submit their articles to their Legitimate profile without the need of having to manually visit the Legitimate website and do it.

When you publish a post on WordPress, the URL will be automatically submitted to Legitimates API (https://www.legitimate.net/api/articles/grab?url=). The Legitimate system will then visit your post and look for the details you added to the Legitimate fields on the edit post page. It will then add a link to the post on your Legitimate profile.
